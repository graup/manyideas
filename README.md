Personalized Motivation-supportive Messages for Increasing Participation in Crowd-civic Systems

## Structure

- analysis: R scripts used to create the statistics, tables, and graphs in the paper.
- backend: Backend server written in Django providing API for the webapp.
- pilot-study: Flask application for the Mturk study.
- post-survey: Flask application for the deployment study post-survey (code mostly identical to pilot-study).
- scripts: deployment scripts
- webapp: Vue.js-based mobile web application
- website: Simple landing page with link to the actual webapp.

## Roadmap

I'm currently working on improving the code for easier reuse by others. This includes:

- Refactoring of the pilot-study Flask code to be usable by other surveys
- Refactoring the context specific contents so that the app can be redeployed easily in other contexts
- Improving documentation
